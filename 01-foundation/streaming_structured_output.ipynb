      "**The Rainbow's End**\n",
      "\n",
      "Once in the shimmering Valley of Lumina, where the skies were always painted in vibrant hues, lived a gentle unicorn named Liora. With a mane that glistened like stardust, Liora was beloved by all the animals in the valley. She had a special gift: wherever she trotted, flowers bloomed, and rainbows arched in the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite her joyful spirit, Liora had one worry: she had never seen the end of a rainbow. Legends spoke of treasures and wonders found there, and Liora longed to experience this magic.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, after a rainstorm, a radiant rainbow appeared. With determination in her heart, Liora set off to find its end. She trotted through fields of daisies, over sparkling streams, and beneath towering trees, guided by the vibrant colors above her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Along her journey, Liora met a wise old owl named Oliver. “Where are you off to, dear Liora?” he asked. She told him about her quest to find the end of the rainbow.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, the end of a rainbow is not a place, but a feeling,” Oliver hooted. “It’s a reminder that beauty exists all around us.” Liora thanked him but felt more determined than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "As night fell, Liora continued her journey, finally reaching a clearing where the rainbow seemed to touch the ground. Excitedly, she galloped toward it, but when she arrived, there was no pot of gold, no magical treasure—just a serene pond reflecting the colors of the rainbow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feeling a bit disheartened, Liora looked into the water and saw her reflection. Suddenly, she understood. The treasure was not material, but the love and friendship she had shared along the way. The joy of her journey had filled her heart with magic far richer than gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "With newfound wisdom, Liora returned to her valley. She shared her adventure with the animals, reminding them to cherish their moments together. From that day on, Liora knew that the real beauty of life wasn’t just in seeking treasures but in the magic of each day spent with friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, in the Valley of Lumina, laughter echoed, flowers bloomed, and rainbows continued to light up the sky, reminding everyone of the joy found in every heart.\n",

      "\n",
      "In the context of evaluating text based on custom criteria, LLM (Language Model) serves as a judge by assessing the quality of responses to queries. Here’s a breakdown of how to implement an LLM as a judge:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Evaluation Approaches**  \n",
      "You can utilize an LLM judge in two key ways:\n",
      "- **Reference-based**: This approach compares new responses against an established reference or \"ground truth\" for regression testing, ensuring that the new outputs align with the expected correct answers.\n",
      "- **Open-ended**: This evaluation method establishes custom criteria for assessing responses, which is particularly useful when no predefined reference is available.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Creating an Evaluation Dataset**  \n",
      "A toy Q&A dataset can be created, which should include:\n",
      "- Questions: Inputs to the LLM application  \n",
      "- Target Responses: Approved correct responses  \n",
      "- New Responses: Actual outputs from the system  \n",
      "- Manual Labels: Indications of whether the responses are correct or incorrect with explanations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Prompt Design**  \n",
      "Design the prompt for the LLM evaluator to specify the criteria against which responses are evaluated. Effective prompts improve the quality of judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Report Generation**  \n",
      "After evaluations, generate reports to visualize the outcomes. This can be done in Python using various libraries, allowing you to examine the performance of the LLM judge versus manual labels.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Iterate and Refine**  \n",
      "The process is iterative; by refining prompts and evaluating the judge's consistency with manual labels, you can enhance the overall evaluation quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Requirements  \n",
      "- Basic knowledge of Python and an OpenAI API key to operate the LLM evaluator.\n",
      "- Recommended platform: Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab for best experience and results display.\n",
      "answer type: how-to\n",
      "follow up question: What specific criteria should be set for evaluation?\n",
      "follow up question: How can I implement the reference-based evaluation method?\n",
      "follow up question: What tools are recommended for generating reports?\n"
